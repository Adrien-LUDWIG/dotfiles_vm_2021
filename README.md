# My old dotfiles (2021)

This was my first attempt to dotfiles for a Manjaro virtual machine in 2021! :smile:

If you are interested, here are my [current dotfiles](https://github.com/Adrien-ANTON-LUDWIG/dotfiles). :rocket:

Custom config files for :
- bash
- vim
- polybar
- rofi
- i3
- oh-my-zsh

For the i3 theme search for this git repo of i3wm-themer :
git@github.com:unix121/i3wm-themer.git

Oh-my-zsh git repo :
git@github.com:ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git
